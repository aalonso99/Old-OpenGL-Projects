# Old OpenGL Projects
These are a couple Linux OpenGL games I made to learn the basics of this library. I wouldn't say any of them is playable or even "finished", and they should neither be considered as an example of good programming or OpenGL practices nor part of my current abilities portfolio. The only reasons for me to post it here are to let anyone who is interested to read my projects and discuss my ideas, and to keep track of my own improvements in case I decide to play around with OpenGL again, which I probably will in the future.

These are brief descriptions of each game:
1. **3DPong** is a remake of original PONG, but in three dimensions. It makes use of OpenGL viewports allowing a 2 players mode. There is no timer and no point counter, though.
2. **VAYARUJCAGAME** is, basicly, a joke for my Erasmus friends. The game is about 2 robots playing **Beer Pong**. Unfortunately it was programmed only for Linux and, even worse, it's a buggy mess. However it allows you to change the robots faces and put any texture you want, following the included instructions.

## Dependencies
I believe everything should be included.
